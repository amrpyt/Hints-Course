## Python

The `python` directory contains resources for learning Python, which is a fundamental programming language for AI and Data Science. You'll find Jupyter Notebooks, video lectures, and notes covering topics such as:

- Python basics (data types, control flow, functions, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.)
- File handling
- Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

## Data Science

The `data-science` directory is dedicated to resources for learning Data Science techniques and concepts. It includes Jupyter Notebooks, video lectures, and notes covering topics such as:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Machine Learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc.)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Data Visualization

## Additional Topics

The `additional-topics` directory contains resources for other AI-related topics that may be of interest, such as:

- Computer Vision
- Reinforcement Learning
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Ethics in AI

Each subdirectory within `additional-topics` will have its own set of Jupyter Notebooks, video lectures, notes, and images.
