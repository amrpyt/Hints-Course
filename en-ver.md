# Summary of Intelligent Agents Lectures and Study Plan

## Lecture 1: Introduction to Intelligent Agents

- **Intelligent Agent (عامل ذكي) Concept:** Any entity capable of perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon it through actuators.
- **Properties of an Agent:** Perception, reasoning, decision-making, and action.
- **Agent Function:** Mapping percept sequences to actions.
- **Rational Agent:** Choosing actions that maximize its performance measure.
- **PEAS:** Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors. It provides a framework for designing intelligent agents.
- **Types of Environments:**
  - **Observable:** Fully or partially observable.
  - **Dynamic:** Static or dynamic.
  - **Continuous:** Discrete or continuous.
  - **Deterministic:** Deterministic or stochastic.
  - **Number of Agents:** Single agent or multi-agent.

## Lecture 2: Agent Types

- **Types of Intelligent Agents:**
  - **Simple Reflex Agents:** Take actions based only on the current percept.
  - **Model-Based Reflex Agents:** Use a model of the world to track states and make decisions.
  - **Goal-Based Agents:** Select actions that achieve specific goals.
  - **Utility-Based Agents:** Select actions that maximize expected utility.
  - **Learning Agents:** Improve their behavior over time based on experience.
  - **Problem-Solving Agents:** Use search techniques to find sequences of actions that achieve goals.
- **Problem Formulation:** Identifying actions and necessary states to achieve a goal.
- **State Space:** The set of all possible states in a problem.
- **State Space Search:** Finding a sequence of actions that lead from the initial state to the goal state.

## Lecture 3: State Space Search

- **Representing State Space:** Using a graph to represent problem states and transitions.
- **Problem Definition Components:** Initial state, possible actions, transition model, goal test, path cost.
- **Searching for Solutions:** Using search algorithms to find sequences of actions leading to the goal.
- **Types of Search Algorithms:**
  - **Uninformed Search Algorithms:** Like Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  - **Informed Search Algorithms:** Use additional information to guide the search, like Best-First Search.

## Lecture 4: Search Algorithms

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores the state space level by level.
- **Optimization Problems:** Finding a solution that maximizes (or minimizes) a specific cost function.
- **Local Search Algorithms:** Start with an initial solution and progressively improve it.
- **Hill Climbing Algorithm:** A type of local search that always moves towards the adjacent better solution.
- **Eight Queens Problem:** An example of a search problem solvable using different search algorithms.

## Lecture 5: Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

- **Knowledge Representation:** Capturing knowledge in a formal way that computers can process.
- **Importance of Good Representation:** Facilitates problem-solving.
- **Principle of Representation:** Once a problem is described using a suitable representation, it's almost solved.
- **Issues in Knowledge Representation:** Identifying what information to represent, how to represent it, and choosing the best representation.
- **Inference:** Deriving new facts from existing data.
- **Knowledge-Based Agents:** Use a knowledge base and inference system to solve problems.
- **Knowledge Representation Languages:** Such as predicate calculus, semantic networks, frames, and production rules.
